# Cognifyz_Internship_Projects
Welcome to the Java Coding Projects repository! This repository contains a series of tasks, from beginner to intermediate levels, designed to build foundational Java programming skills. Each task explores a unique coding concept, such as conditional statements, loops, CRUD operations, and file I/O, to develop proficiency in Java.

# Level 1: Beginner
  # Task 1: Text-Based Game
    Objective: Develop a simple text-based game using conditional statements for game logic. Examples include a quiz or guessing game.

    Instructions:

    Choose a game type (e.g., quiz or guessing game).
    Define the rules and logic for the game.
    Use conditional statements to manage the gameâ€™s flow.
    Test and debug to ensure the game functions correctly.
  Files:

    TextGame.java - Main Java file for the game.
 # Task 2: Number Patterns Generator
    Objective: Use loops to generate simple number patterns, such as pyramids or grids.

    Instructions:

    Choose a number pattern to generate (e.g., pyramid).
    Develop a Java program to create the chosen pattern.
    Use loops to control the structure of the pattern.
    Test to confirm the pattern outputs correctly.
  Files:

    NumberPattern.java - Main Java file for generating number patterns.
# Level 2: Intermediate
 # Task 3: Basic CRUD Application
    Objective: Create a console-based application to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a list of tasks.

    Instructions:

    Define a Task class with attributes like title, description, and status.
    Implement functionality to create a new task.
    Add a method to read and display tasks.
    Allow users to update task details.
    Provide an option to delete tasks.
    Test the application with various scenarios to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
  Files:

    TaskCrud.java - Main Java file for the CRUD application.
    Task.java - Class file defining the Task structure.
  # Task 4: Temperature Converter
    Objective: Build a temperature converter that allows users to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

    Instructions:

    Design the program to accept temperature input from the user.
    Implement the logic for temperature conversion.
    Let the user choose the conversion direction (Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa).
    Test the program with different inputs to verify accuracy.
  Files:

    TemperatureConverter.java - Main Java file for the temperature converter.
  # Task 5: Enhanced CRUD with Persistent Storage
    Objective: Expand the CRUD application by enabling persistent storage using file I/O, allowing tasks to be saved to and loaded from a text file.

    Instructions:

    Modify the CRUD application to read from and write to a text file.
    Add error handling for file operations.
    Test to confirm that tasks persist even after the program is closed and restarted.
    Files:

      TaskCrudPersistent.java - Main Java file with persistent storage functionality.
      tasks.txt - Text file for storing tasks (automatically created and managed by the program).
# Getting Started with IntelliJ IDEA
  # Prerequisites
    Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure the JDK is installed and configured on your machine.
    IntelliJ IDEA: Install the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA.
    Steps to Open and Run Projects in IntelliJ IDEA
      Clone the Repository:

      bash
      Copy code
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
      Open IntelliJ IDEA:

      Select File > Open... and choose the cloned project folder.
      Open Individual Task Files:

      Open the src folder to locate individual Java files such as TextGame.java, NumberPattern.java, etc.
      Open the file corresponding to the task you want to run.
      Run the Java File:

      Right-click on the file (e.g., TextGame.java) and select Run 'TextGame.main()'.
      The program will execute in the terminal window at the bottom of IntelliJ IDEA.
      Running Multiple Files:

      Repeat the above steps for each task or Java file as needed.
